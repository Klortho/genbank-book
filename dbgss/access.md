## Â Access to dbGSS Data

*   GSS sequences are included in the GSS division of GenBank available from NCBI by anonymous ftp and through Entrez.
*   The nucleotide sequences may be searched using the BLAST electronic mail server or from the BLAST web pages. For more information send an e-mail message with the word "help" in the body of the message to blast@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The TBLASTN program which takes an amino acid query sequence and compares it with six-frame translations of dbGSS DNA sequences is particularly useful.
*   GSS sequences are also available as a flat file in the FASTA format by anonymous FTP in the /repository/dbGSS directory at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
