# Data Submissions During Federal Government Shutdown

*   **If you have already submitted to us, but are willing to wait**, do not resubmit because your submissions are queued and will be processed when government funding resumes.

*   **If you urgently need accession numbers for publication**, you may consider submitting to one of the other INSDC partners:
    *   DDBJ - [http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/submission_general-e.html](http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/submission_general-e.html), or
    *   ENA - [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/submit_and_update](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/submit_and_update)

*   **If you decide to submit sequences to DDBJ or ENA that were previously submitted to GenBank**, please send an email to [gb-admin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](mailto:gb-admin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), so that we can delete the duplicate submission that is here.
