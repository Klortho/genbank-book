## Access to dbEST Data

*   EST sequences are included in the EST division of GenBank, available from NCBI by anonymous ftp and through Entrez.
*   The nucleotide sequences may be searched using the BLAST electronic mail server. The TBLASTN program which takes an amino acid query sequence and compares it with six-frame translations of dbEST DNA sequences is particularly useful.
*   EST sequences are also available as a flat file in the FASTA format by anonymous ftp in the /repository/dbEST directory at ftp.ncbi.nih.gov
