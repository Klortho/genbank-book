# Submitting your HTG files by FTP

Once your HTG submission file is created you must submit it to NCBI via the FTP site we created for your center.

If you do not yet have a FTP account you should contact NCBI ([htgs-adm@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](mailto:htgs-adm@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)) to set up an FTP account. To set up a new FTP account we will need this information from you.

1) Would you be the only contact person? If not and there are others who should also be contacted regularly about these submissions, please supply us with their names and e-mail addresses, or preferably, create an email alias at your end for your group's use. [We will also need your phone and FAX numbers, as additional contact info.]

2) We need a genome center abbreviation which would be used as your login name (lower case only).

3) Include a description of your project and an estimate of how many sequences you will be submitting.

Once we have this information, we will establish an ftp account and contact you to let you know the password, and you can then submit your records to the HTG system.

### FTP applications

There are a variety of FTP clients that you can use to submit your HTG files. We recommend either linux or unix command line applications. Using any FTP client (or command line) you should be able to connect with the login and password that was provided to you.

The machine you are connecting to is ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

<pre>ftp to : ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
     login : <login was provided to you>
  password : <use provided password></pre>

Linux command line ftp or Unix command line **ncftp**

for example ftp ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

FileZilla works but we no longer recommended this application as there are reports that it has been infected with malware/virus. The FileZilla settings are:

server name > ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

protocol > FTP

port leave blank

SecureFX can be used with these settings:

protocol > FTP

terminal > NONE

use PASV mode

Hostname > ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
