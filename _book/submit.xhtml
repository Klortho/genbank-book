<h1 id="how-to-submit-data-to-genbank">How to submit data to
GenBank</h1>
<p>The most important source of new data for
GenBank<sup>&#174;</sup> is direct submissions from scientists.
GenBank depends on its contributors to help keep the database as
comprehensive, current, and accurate as possible. NCBI provides
timely and accurate processing and biological review of new entries
and updates to existing entries, and is ready to assist authors who
have new data to submit.</p>
<h3 id="receiving-an-accession-number-for-your-manuscript">
Receiving an Accession Number for your Manuscript</h3>
<p>Most journals require DNA and amino acid sequences that are
cited in articles be submitted to a public sequence repository
(DDBJ/EMBL/Genbank - INSDC) as part of the publication process.
Data exchange between DDBJ, EMBL and GenBank occurs daily so it is
only necessary to submit the sequence to one database, whichever
one is most convenient, without regard for where the sequence may
be published. Sequence data submitted in advance of publication can
be kept confidential if requested. GenBank will provide accession
numbers for submitted sequences, usually within two working days.
This accession number serves as an identifier for your submitted
your data, and allows the community to retrieve the sequence upon
reading the journal article. The accession number should be
included in your manuscript, preferably in a footnote on the first
page of the article, or as required by individual journal
procedures.</p>
<h3 id="submissions-to-genbank">Submissions to GenBank</h3>
<p>There are several options for submitting data to GenBank:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/?tool=genbank"
target="_blank">BankIt</a>, a WWW-based submission tool with
wizards to guide the submission process</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/" target=
"_blank">Sequin</a>, NCBI's stand-alone submission tool with
wizards to guide the submission process is available by FTP for use
on for MAC, PC, and UNIX platforms.</li>
<li><a href="~/tbl2asn2">tbl2asn</a>, a command-line program,
automates the creation of sequence records for submission to
GenBank using many of the same functions as Sequin. It is used
primarily for submission of complete genomes and large batches of
sequences and is available by FTP for use on MAC, PC and Unix
platforms.</li>
<li><a href="https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" target=
"_blank">Submission Portal</a>, a unified system for multiple
submission types. Currently only 16S ribosomal RNA from
bacteria/archaea can be submitted with the GenBank component of
this tool. This will be expanded in the future to include other
types of GenBank submissions. Genome and Transcriptome Assemblies
can be submitted through the WGS and TSA portals,
respectively.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/?tool=barcode"
target="_blank">Barcode Submission Tool</a>, a WWW-based tool for
the submission of sequences and trace read data for <a href=
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/barcode.html" target=
"_blank">Barcode of Life</a> projects based on the COI gene.</li>
</ul>
<p>BankIt, Submission Portal and Barcode Submission Tool entries
are automatically submitted to GenBank. Submissions made with
Sequin or tbl2asn must be mailed to <a href=
"mailto:gb-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target=
"_blank">gb-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>. Large files which may be
truncated during mailing with conventional mail tools should be
submitted directly using <a href=
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LargeDirSubs/dir_submit.cgi" target=
"_blank">Sequin MacroSend</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href=
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/feed/rss.cgi?ChanKey=genbanksubmissiontoo"
target="_blank">subscribe</a> <img src=
"core/assets/genbank/images/29146.png" alt="RSS_feed" /> to be
notified of updates to the submission tools.</p>
<p>There are specialized, streamlined procedures for batch
submissions of sequences, such as <a href=
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/how_to_submit.html" target=
"_blank">EST</a> and <a href=
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbGSS/how_to_submit.html" target=
"_blank">GSS</a> sequences.</p>
<h3 id="submissions-of-raw-sequence-reads">Submissions of Raw
Sequence Reads</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reads of Sanger-style sequencing can be submitted to the
<a href=
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?cmd=show&amp;f=submit&amp;m=doc&amp;s=submit"
target="_blank">Trace Archive</a>.</li>
<li>Runs of next-generation sequencing, for example from 454 or
Illumina, can be submitted to the <a href=
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra_sub/sub.cgi?&amp;m=submissions&amp;s=defaults"
target="_blank">Sequence Read Archive (SRA)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="updating-or-revising-a-genbank-sequence">Updating or
Revising a GenBank Sequence</h3>
<p>Revisions or updates to GenBank entries can be made by the
submitters at any time. Information about the correct format for
different types of updates can be found on the <a href=
"~/update">Update guidelines</a> page. Send updates and revisions
to <a href="mailto:gb-admin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target=
"_blank">gb-admin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>. Be sure to include the
accession number of the sequence to be updated in the subject
line.</p>
<h3 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h3>
<p>Some authors are concerned that the appearance of their data in
GenBank prior to publication will compromise their work. GenBank
will, upon request, withhold release of new submissions for a
specified period of time. However, if a paper citing the sequence
or accession number is published prior to the specified date, your
sequence will be released upon publication. In order to prevent the
delay in the appearance of published sequence data, we urge authors
to inform us of the appearance of the published data. As soon as it
is available, please send the full publication data--all authors,
title, journal, volume, pages and date--to the following address:
<a href="mailto:update@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target=
"_blank">update@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a></p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>If you are submitting human sequences to GenBank, do not include
any data that could reveal the personal identity of the source. It
is our assumption that you have received any necessary informed
consent authorizations that your organizations require prior to
submitting your sequences.</p>
