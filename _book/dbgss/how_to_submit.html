<p>Please ensure that your submissions follow these sequence quality and file formatting guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>Sequence Quality and Content:</strong></p>
<p>[1] Please submit only single-pass sequences (no next-gen sequences, raw or assembled)</p>
<p>[2] Remove: vector, linker, adaptor, mitochondrial, ribosomal, and contaminant sequences</p>
<p>[3] Use VecScreen to identify any vector, linker, or adaptors (accepts multiple sequences in fasta format)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/</a></p>
<p>[4] Trim terminal N&apos;s from 5&apos; or 3&apos; ends.  Sequences should not begin or end with N.</p>
<p>[5] Remove any low quality sequences.  These have high number of N&apos;s and/or long stretches of polynucleotides throughout. </p>
<p>Examples of low quality sequences:</p>
<p>SEQUENCE:</p>
<p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCGGGGGGGGGGGGG</p>
<p>SEQUENCE:</p>
<p>CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCTCCCCCCCCCCCCTCCCCCCCCCCCCCC</p>
<p>SEQUENCE:</p>
<p>TNNCANNNNGNNNGGNNCNNANNNNNTGCNNNNNNTTNNAANNGCAANNNNTG</p>
<p><strong>File Formatting:</strong></p>
<p>[6] Please send your submission as two text files:</p>
<pre><code> plc.txt   contains publication, library, and contact files

 gss.txt   contains all GSS submissions
</code></pre><p>[7] Ensure that all GSS# are unique</p>
<p>[8] GSS file CITATION must exactly match Pub file TITLE</p>
<p>[9] GSS file LIBRARY must exactly match Lib file NAME</p>
<p>[10] GSS file CONT_NAME must exactly match Cont file NAME</p>
<p>[11] Use only standard 26 letters of the English alphabet (no accent marks, umlauts, etc.)</p>
<p>[12] PUT_ID field should not contain organism, hypothetical protein, unknown, or similar info</p>
<p>[13] The following represent the most common fields for each file:</p>

<p>GSSs by nature are usually submitted to GenBank and dbGSS as batches of dozens to thousands of entries, with a great deal of redundancy in the citation, submittor and library information. To improve the efficiency of the submission process for this type of data, we have designed a separate streamlined submission process and data format.</p>
<p>NOTE: Beginning in 2009 Sequences derived from &quot;next generation&quot; sequencing platforms, including Roche 454, Illumina, Applied Biosystems SOLiD, and Helicos Biosciences HeliScope, should be submitted to the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?" target="_blank">Short Read Archive (SRA)</a> (For information contact sra@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.)</p>
<h2 id="data-submission-file-types">Data submission file types</h2>
<p>The batch submission process for <a href="#Submission%20Format%20for%20GSS%20Sequence%20Data">GSS sequence data</a> involves the completion of four file types:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#Publication%20Files">Publication</a>  </li>
<li><a href="#Library%20Files">Library</a>  </li>
<li><a href="#Contact%20Files">Contact</a>  </li>
<li><a href="#GSS%20Files">GSS sequence file</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The format for each file is described below.</p>
<p>If all the GSSs share the same Publication, Library, and Contact information, you only need to prepare one of each of those files. Then complete a separate GSS file (file type d) for each sequence.</p>
<p>If any of the GSS files have different Publication, Library, or Contact information, you must complete a new set of file types 1-3.</p>
<p>Once we have entered particular Publication, Library, or Contact information into the database, you do not need to resend the data input files.</p>
<h2 id="mailing-files-to-dbgss">Mailing files to dbGSS</h2>
<p>Send the completed files to: <a href="mailto:batch-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank">batch-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a></p>
<p>You can attach all the files to a single email message, or you can include them in the body of the email message. Please be sure that they are in plain text (ASCII) format.</p>
<p>We prefer to have the individual GSS batched together as much as possible.</p>
<p>You can submit Publication, Library, and Contact data together in one file. You can also send them in the same file as the GSS entries - the TYPE field will differentiate them for the parsing software.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-of-genbank-accession-numbers-and-release-of-data">Assignment of GenBank Accession numbers and release of data</h2>
<p>You will receive a list of dbGSS IDs and GenBank Accession numbers from a dbGSS curator via email.</p>
<p>If you would like your sequences held confidential until publication, you can indicate that by putting the release date in the PUBLIC field of the GSS files. Your sequences will be released on that date, or when the Accession numbers or sequence data are published, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>Once your sequences are released into the public database, they will be available from the GSS division of GenBank (accessible through the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Nucleotide" target="_blank">Entrez Nucleotide</a> division).</p>
<h2 id="updating-your-dbgss-data">Updating your dbGSS data</h2>
<p>Updates to GSS entries are done basically in the same way as new entries. Changes to any item in the GSS input file (other than GSS# or CONT_NAME) are made by completing an input file with new data in the fields that need to be changed. For the STATUS field, enter &quot;Update&quot; instead of &quot;New&quot;.</p>
<p>In addition to the fields to be changed Updates need to include TYPE, STATUS, GSS#, and CONT_NAME fields.</p>
<p>For changes in Publication, Contact, or Source data, or for changes in GSS#&apos;s or CONT_NAME, send an email message describing the change that is needed.</p>
<p>Send the update files to: <a href="mailto:batch-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank">batch-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a></p>
<h2 id="questions-and-comments">Questions and Comments</h2>
<p>If you have questions about the GSS submission format, please contact <a href="mailto:info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank">info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="submission-format-for-gss-sequence-data"><a name="Submission Format for GSS Sequence Data"></a>Submission Format for GSS Sequence Data</h2>
<p>The following is a specification for flat file formats for delivering GSS and related data to the NCBI GSS database.</p>
<ul>
<li>The format consists of colon delineated capitalized field tags, followed by data.</li>
<li>The data fields should appear on the same line as the tag, with no line wrapping.  Exceptions to this are the TITLE and AUTHORS fields of the Publication file; Description (DESCR:) field of the Library file; and the CITATION, COMMENT, and SEQUENCE fields of the GSS file. In these fields, the data text begins on the same line as the tag or on the line following the field tag, and the text can cover several lines.</li>
<li>Note that some fields are obligatory.</li>
<li>The TYPE field is obligatory at the beginning of each entry, even if there are multiple entries of a given type in a file.</li>
<li>If data are not available for a non-obligatory field, the field can either be omitted entirely, or the tag may be included with an empty data field.  Please do not put &quot;*&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, etc. to indicate missing data.</li>
<li>Each record (including the last record in the file) should end with a double-bar tag (||) to indicate the end of the record.</li>
<li>Please also see the bulleted tips at the end of each file format for important notes about that file type.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="file-types">File Types</h3>
<p>There are four types of deliverable files:<br>1. <a href="#Publication%20Files">Publication</a><br>2. <a href="#Library%20Files">Library</a><br>3. <a href="#Contact%20Files">Contact</a><br>4. <a href="#GSS%20Files">GSS sequence file</a></p>
<p>Each GSS file needs to reference the Publication, Library, and Contact data.  Therefore the Publication, Library, and Contact files must be in the database when the GSS file is entered. Once these files have been submitted and entered, they do not need to be re-submitted for additional GSS files that have the same Publication, Library, or Contact.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-publication-files">1. <a name="Publication Files"></a>Publication Files</h3>
<p>The following is an example of the valid tags and some illustrative data:</p>

<li>The TITLE field is a free format string. The only requirement is that you put an identical string in the CITATION field of the GSS files, because we will be matching that field automatically against the publications in the publication table and replacing the string with the publication identity number in the GSS table.</li>
